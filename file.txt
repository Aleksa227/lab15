Sometimes we need to be hurt in order to grow. We must lose in order to gain. Sometimes some lessons are learned best through pain.
 Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path.
A satisfied life is better than a successful life. Because our success is measured by others, but our satisfaction is measured by our own soul, mind and heart.
